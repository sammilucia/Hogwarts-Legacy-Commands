r.AOUpdateGlobalDistanceField			; Whether to update the global distance field, useful for debugging.
r.AOUseHistory			; Whether to apply a temporal filter to the distance field AO, which reduces flickering but also adds trails when occluders are moving.

r.Cache.LightingCacheMovableObjectAllocationSize			; Resolution of the interpolation sample volume used to light a dynamic object.   Values of 1 or 2 will result in a single interpolation sample per object which does not provide continuous lighting under movement, so interpolation is done over time.   Values of 3 or more support the necessary padding to provide continuous results under movement.
r.Cache.LimitQuerySize			; 0 is off, 1 is on (default)
r.Cache.QueryNodeLevel			; Level of the lighting sample octree whose node's extents should be the target size for queries into the octree. Primitive blocks will be broken up into multiple octree queries if they are larger than this.0 is the root, 12 is the leaf level

r.CompileMaterialsForShaderFormat			; When enabled, compile materials for this shader format in addition to those for the running platform. Note that these shaders are compiled and immediately tossed. This is only useful when directly inspecting output via r.DebugDumpShaderInfo.
r.CompileShadersForDevelopment			; Setting this to 0 allows to ship a game with more optimized shaders as some editor and development features are not longer compiled into the shaders.  Note: This should be done when shipping but it's not done automatically yet (feature need to mature        and shaders will compile slower as shader caching from development isn't shared).

r.Composure.CompositingElements.Debug.UseInternalPassLists			; To manage compositing pass objects that are no longer active, but alive (in the transaction buffer), element objects keep an internal copy of their pass lists, and run off that instead of iterating over the user exposed one.  In case these lists get out of sync, this toggle lets you poll the user set ones directly.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.DisableActiveRendering			; Composure compositing elements normally automatically enqueue render commands (both in game and editor). This CVar can be used as a shunt to control perf, where you can shut off all active element rendering.

This may leave render resources pooled, but never reclaimed. Auto-Flushing returns those resources. For values greater than zero, the pooling system will wait that number of frames before a target is considered 'stale'.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.Editor.DecoupleRenderingFromLevelViewport			; In editor, this decouples the compositing rendering from the editor's level rendering (to not be limited by the on-demand rendering style it sometimes uses). It uses a dedicated (hidden) viewport to enqueue the compositing render commands.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.Editor.ForceApplyGammaToPreview			; By default we don't do gamma correction if the user has set up a preview transform on the compositing tree.  If you'd like to use a preview transform, and apply gamma on top of that, then enable this settong.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.Editor.RealtimeRendering			; Turns on/off the realtime compositing rendering done by the dedicated compositing viewport.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.Editor.WarnWhenSceneCaptureIsMissingCamera			; By default, scene capture (CG) elements rely on a camera to position themselves.

r.Composure.CompositingElements.InternalPrePassParamName			; For compositing elements, each material pass can ganerally reference the pass that came before it using this predefined parameter name.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.ReuseIntermediatePassTargets			; To lighten the Render Target load, set this to release intermediate pass targets back to the pool so they can be used by other, subsequent passes.
r.Composure.CompositingElements.UseBlackForDisabledPasses			; With this enabled, if a compositing material's source element is disabled, then we use a hardcoded black/transparent texture in its place. If you disable this, then it will use whatever the default sampler texture is in the material.
r.Composure.PipelineActors.SuspendEditorInstancesWithPIE			; This suspends composure editor rendering when you're in PIE. The PIE instances will still render, just their Editor world counterparts will temporarily stop. If disabled, both insances (the Editor's and their corespponding copies in PIE) will render at the same time - taxing resources, and slowing down the renderer.
r.ContactShadows			;  0: disabled.  1: enabled. 
r.ContactShadows.NonShadowCastingIntensity			; Intensity of contact shadows from objects with cast contact shadows disabled. Usually 0 (off). 
r.CookOutUnusedDetailModeComponents			; If set, components which are not relevant for the current detail mode will be cooked out.  0: keep components even if not relevant for the current detail mode.  1: cook out components not relevant for the current detail mode.

An error is reported when this limit is reached and shader bindings for subsequent objects are skipped. 
r.D3D12.UseAllowTearing			; Enable new dxgi flip mode with d3d12
r.DBuffer			; Enables DBuffer decal material blend modes. DBuffer decals are rendered before the base pass, allowing them to affect static lighting and skylighting correctly.  When enabled, a full prepass will be forced which adds CPU / GPU cost.  Several texture lookups will be done in the base pass to fetch the decal properties, which adds pixel work.  0: off  1: on (default)
